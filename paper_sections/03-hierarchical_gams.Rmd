# III: What are hierarchical GAMs?

## What do we mean by hierarchical smooths?

The smoothers in section II allowed us to model flexible relationships between our response and predictor variables. In this section, we will describe how to model model inter-group variability using smooth curves and how to fit these models in `mgcv`. Model structure is key in this framework, so we start with three choices:

1. Should each group have its own smooth, or will a global smooth term suffice?

2. Do all of the group-specific curves have the same smoothness, or should each group have its own smoothing parameter?

3. Will the smooths for each group have a similar shape to one another -- a shared average curve[^shape]?

[^shape]: For this paper, we consider two functions to have similar shape if the
average squared distance between the functions is small (assuming the functions
have been scaled to have a mean value of zero across their ranges). This definition
is somewhat restricted; for instance, a cyclic function would not be considered to
have the same shape as a phase-shifted version of that function, nor would two 
normal distributions with the same mean but different standard deviations. The 
benefit of this definition of shape, however, is that it is straightforward to
translate into quadratic penalties as we have been using. 


These three choices result in five possible models (figure \ref{fig:models}), beyond the null model of "no relation between response and predictor(s)".:

1. A single common smooth for all observations.

2. A single common smooth plus group-level smooths that have the same wigglyness.

3. A single common smooth plus group-level smooths with differing wigglyness.

4. Group-specific smooths without an average trend, but with all smooths having the same wigglyness.

5. Group-specific smooths with different wigglyness.

It is important to note that "similar wiggliness" and "similar shape" are distinct ideas; two functions can have very similar wiggliness but very different shapes. Wiggliness simply measures how quickly a function changes across its range, and it is easy to construct two functions that differ in shape but have the same wiggliness. For example, a logistic curve might have the same squared total second derivative between -1 and +1 as a sine curve, but they have very different shapes. Figure \ref{fig:models}, model 4 illustrates this case. 
Similarly, two curves could have very similar overall shape, but differ in their wiggliness. For instance, if one function was equal to the second function plus a high-frequency osscilation. Figure \ref{fig:models} model 3 illustrates this. 

We will discuss the trade-offs between different models and guidelines about when each of these models is appropriate in section IV. The remainder of this section will focus on how to specify each of these five models using `mgcv`.

## Coding hierarchical GAMs in R

**EJP: Going with canned and simulated data for the examples rather than real as it's a bit less messy**

Each of these models can be coded straightforwardly in `mgcv`. To help illustrate this throughout the section when describing how to set these models up, we will refer to the response variable as $y$,  continuous predictor variables as $x$ (or $x_1$ and  $x_2$, in the case multiple predictors), and $\text{fac}$ to designate the discrete grouping factor whose variation we are interested in understanding.

We will also use two example datasets to demonstrate how to code these models (see the appendix for code to generate these examples):

A. The `CO2` dataset, available in R in the `datasets` package. This data is from an experimental study by @potvin_statistical_1990 of $\text{CO}_2$ uptake in grasses under varying concentrations of $\text{CO}_2$, measuring how concentration-uptake functions varied between plants from two locations (Mississippi and Quebec) and two temperature treatments (chilled and warm). A total of 12 plants were measured, and uptake measured at 7 concentration levels for each plant (figure \ref{fig:vis_data}a). Here we will focus on how to use these techniques to estimate inter-plant variation in functional responses.

B. A hypothetical study of what bird movement might look like along a migration corridor, sampled throughout the year. We have simulated this data for this paper (see supplemental code XX). This dataset consists of records of numbers of observed locations of 100 tagged individuals each from six species of bird, at ten locations along a latitudinal gradient, with one observation taken every four weeks. Not every bird was observed at each time point, so counts vary randomly between location and week. The data set (`bird_move`) consists of the variables `count`, `latitude`, `week` and `species` (figure \ref{fig:vis_data}b). This example will allow us to demonstrate how to fit these models with interactions and with non-normal (count) data.

```

It is important to note that the grouping variable should be coded in R as an unordered factor -- a character will raise an error and numeric will lead to a completely different model specification. Whether the factor is ordered or not will not matter for most of the smoothers we use here. However, for models 3&5 order will matter (see below for further details).

Throughout the examples we use Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) to estimate model coefficients and smoothing parameters. We strongly recommend using either REML or marginal likelihood (ML) when fitting GAMs for the reasons outlined in [@wood_fast_2011].

In each case some data processing and manipulation has been done to obtain the graphics and results below. We recommend readers take a look at the source RMarkdown [CITE] document for this paper to get the full code.

### A single common smooth for all observations (Model 1)

We start with the simplest model we can in our framework and include many details here to ensure that readers are comfortable with the terminology and R functions we are going to use later.

For our `CO2` data set, we will model $\log_e(\texttt{uptake})$ as a function of two smooths: a thin plate regression spline of $\log{}$ concentration, and a random effect for species to model species-specific intercepts [^mult_note]. Mathematically:

$$
\log_e(\texttt{uptake}_i) = f(\log_e(\texttt{conc}_i)) + \zeta_\texttt{Plant\_uo} + \epsilon_i
$$


where $\zeta_\texttt{Plant\_uo}$ is the random effect for plant and $\epsilon_i$ is a Gaussian error term. We assume that $\log_e(\texttt{uptake}_i)$ is normally distributed.

**DLM: not sure if this note is necessary...**

**DLM: need to justify why we use log concentration not just concentration? (could just cite?)**

**I think it's useful here as it shows one approach to deal with multipliciative functional variation. I've simplified it to remove the note about log-transforming concentration though. The reasons for that should be obvious**

[^mult_note]:Note that we're actually modelling ln(uptake); this can be a useful approach when dealing with estimating multiple functional relationships as it means that functions that differ from each other by a multiplicative constant (so $f_1(x) = \alpha\cdot f_2(x)$ will differ by an additive constant when log-transformed (which can be estimated by simple random effects): $ln(f_1(x)) = ln(\alpha)+ ln(f_2(x))$.

In R we can write our model as:
```{r co2_mod1_unrun, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
CO2_mod1 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k = 5, bs = "tp") +
                              s(Plant_uo, k = 12, bs = "re"),
                data=CO2, method="REML")
```

This is the typical GAM setup, with a single smooth term for each variable. Specifying the model is similar to specifying a `glm` in R, with the addition of `s()` terms to include one-dimensional or isotropic multidimensional smooths. The first argument to `s()` is the terms to be smoothed, the type of smooth to be used for the term is specified by the `bs=...` argument, and the number of basis functions is specified by `k=...`.

```{r co2_mod1, echo=FALSE,  fig.width=6, fig.height=3, cache=TRUE,fig.cap="\\label{fig:co2_mod1}mgcv plotting output for model 1 applied to the CO2 dataset."}
library(mgcv)
library(ggplot2)

#The default CO2 plant variable is ordered;
#This recodes it to an unordered factor (see above for why).
CO2 <- transform(CO2, Plant_uo=factor(Plant, ordered=FALSE))

CO2_mod1 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k=5, bs="tp") +
                              s(Plant_uo, k=12, bs="re"),
                data=CO2, method="REML")

plot(CO2_mod1, pages=1, seWithMean = TRUE)
```

Figure \ref{fig:co2_mod1} illustrates `mgcv'`s default plotting out for `CO2_mod1`: the left panel shows the estimated global functional relationship, and the right shows a quantile-quantile plot of the estimates effects vs Guassian quantiles, which can be used to check our model.

**DLM: add more to plot description!**

Looking at the effects by term is useful but we are often interested in fitted values or predictions our models. This can be useful to construct plots (like those in Figure \ref{fig:co2_mod1_predict}). The next block of code shows how you could plot this to illustrate inter-plant variation in the functional response, plotting untransformed uptake and concentration to make the figure easier to interpret. 


```{r co2_mod1_ggplot, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="\\label{fig:co2_mod1_predict}"
# setup prediction data
CO2_mod1_pred <- with(CO2,
                      expand.grid(conc=seq(min(conc), max(conc), length=100),
                                  Plant_uo=levels(Plant_uo)))
# make the prediction, add this and a column of standard errors to the prediction
# data.frame. Predictions are on the log scale.
CO2_mod1_pred <- cbind(CO2_mod1_pred,
                       predict(CO2_mod1, CO2_mod1_pred, se.fit=TRUE))

# make the plot
ggplot(data=CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake, group=Plant_uo)) +
    facet_wrap(~Plant_uo) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line(aes(y=exp(fit)), data=CO2_mod1_pred) +
    geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=exp(fit - 2*se.fit), ymax=exp(fit + 2*se.fit), x=conc),
                data=CO2_mod1_pred, alpha=0.3, inherit.aes=FALSE)
```

We can include interactions in an `s()` term via isotropic smooths such as thin plate regression splines or we can use the tensor product (`te()`) function, if we don't believe the composite terms are isotropic. In this case `bs` and `k` can be specified as a single value (in which case each marginal smooth has the same basis or complexity) or as a vector of basis types or complexities. For example, `y~te(x1,x2, k=c(10,5), bs=c("tp","cs"))`, would specify a non-isotropic smooth of `x1` and `x2`, with the marginal basis for `x1` being a thin plate regression spline with 10 basis functions, and the smooth of `x2` being a cubic regression spline with a penalty on the null space.

For our bird example, we want to look at the interaction between location and time, so for this we setup the model as:

$$
\texttt{count}_i = \exp(f(\texttt{week}_i, \texttt{latitude}_i))
$$

where we assume that $\texttt{count}_i \sim\text{Poisson}$. For the smooth term, $f$, we employ a tensor product of latitude and week, using a thin plate regression spline for the marginal latitude effects, and a cyclic cubic spline for the marginal week effect to account for the cyclic nature of weekly effects (we expect week 1 and week 52 to have very similar values), both splines had basis complexity (`k`) of 10. We will also assume the counts of individuals at each location in each week follow a Poisson distribution, and we will ignore
species-specific variability. 

```{r bird_mod1, fig.width = 4, fig.height = 4, fig.cap="\\label{fig:bird_mod1}The default plot for this GAM illustrates the average log-abundance of all bird species at each latitude for each week, with yellow colours indicating more individuals and red colours fewer."}
library(tidyr)
library(viridis) # for color plotting

bird_move <- read.csv("../data/bird_move.csv") # load data

bird_mod1 <- gam(count ~ te(week, latitude, bs=c("cc", "tp"), k=c(10, 10)),
                 data=bird_move, method="REML", family=poisson)

plot(bird_mod1, pages=1, scheme=2, rug=FALSE)
box()
```

Figure \ref{fig:bird_mod1} shows birds starting at low latitudes in the winter then migrating to high latitudes from the 10th to 20th week, staying there for 15-20 weeks, then migrating back. However, the plot also indicates a large amount of variability in the timing of migration. The source of this variability is apparent when looking at the specifics of migration timing of each species (figure \ref{fig:vis_data}b). 

All six species in figure \ref{fig:vis_data}b) show relatively precise migration patterns, but they differ in the timing of when they leave their winter grounds and the time they spend at their summer grounds. Averaging over all of this variation results in a relatively imprecise (diffuse) average estimate of migration timing (figure \ref{fig:bird_mod1}, \ref{fig:bird-fitted-mod1}), and viewing species-specific plots of observed versus predicted values (figure \ref{fig:bird-fitted-mod1}), it is appearent that the model fits some of the species better than others. This model could potentially be improved by adding inter-group variation in migration timing. The rest of this section will focus on how to model this type of variation. 

```{r bird-fitted-mod1,fig.cap="\\label{fig:bird-fitted-mod1}Observed counts by species versus predicted counts from bird_mod1 (1-1 line added as reference). If our model fitted well we would expect that all species should show similiar dispersions around the 1-1 line. Instead we see that variance around the predicted is much higher for species 1 and 6."}

```



### A single common smooth plus group-level smooths that have the same wigglyness (Model 2)


Model 2 is a close analogue to a GLMM with varying slopes: all groups have similar functional responses, but allows for inter-group variation in responses. This approach works by allowing each grouping level to have its own functional response, but penalizing functions that are too far from the average.

This can be coded in `mgcv` by explicitly specifying one term for the global smooth (as in model 1 above) then adding a second smooth term specifying the group level smooth terms, using a penalty term that tends to draw these group-level smooths to zero. For one-dimensional smooths, `mgcv` provides an explicit basis type to do this, the factor smooth or "fs" basis (see `?smooth.construct.fs.smooth.spec` for detailed notes). This smoother creates a copy of each set of basis functions for each level of the grouping variable, but only estimates one set of smoothing parameters for all groups. The penalty is also set up so each component of its null space is given its own penalty (so that all components of the smooth are penalized towards zero)[^intercept_note]. As there can be issues of co-linearity between the global smooth term and the group-specific terms (see section V for more details), it is generally necessary to use a smoother with a more restricted null space than the global smooth; for thin plate splines this can be done by setting m=2 for the global smooth and m=1 for the group smooth [@baayen_autocorrelated_2016] [also cite Wieling paper here]. e.g.: `y~s(x,bs="tp",m=2)+s(x,fac,bs="fs",m=1,xt=list(bs="tp"))`. 



[^intercept_note]: As part of the penalty construction, each group will also have its own intercept (part of the penalized null space), so there is no need to add a separate term for group specific intercepts as we did in model 1.


We modify our previous $\text{CO}_2$ model as follows:

$$
\log_e(\texttt{uptake}_i) = f(\log_e(\texttt{conc}_i)) + f_{\texttt{Plant\_uo}_i}(\log_e(\texttt{conc}_i)) + \epsilon_i
$$

where $f_{\texttt{Plant\_uo}_i}(\log_e(\texttt{conc}_i))$ is the smooth of concentration for the given plant. In R we then have:

```{r co2_mod2-norun, eval=FALSE}
CO2_mod2 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k=5, m=2, bs="tp") +
                              s(log(conc), Plant_uo, k=5,  bs="fs", m=1),
                data=CO2, method="REML")
```

```{r co2_mod2, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="\\label{fig:co2_mod2}Global function (left) and group-specific deviations from the global function (right) for CO2_mod2"}
source("../code/functions.R")

CO2_mod2 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k=5, m=2, bs="tp") +
                              s(log(conc), Plant_uo, k=5,  bs="fs", m=1),
                data=CO2, method="REML")

plot(CO2_mod2, page=1, seWithMean=TRUE)
```

Figure \ref{fig:co2_mod2} shows the fitted smoothers for `CO2_mod2`. The plots of group-specific smooths indicate that plants differ not only in average log-uptake (which would correspond to each plant having a straight line at different levels for the group-level smooth), but differ slightly in the shape of their functional responses. Figure \ref{fig:co2_mod2_pred} shows how the global and group-specific smooths combine to predict uptake rates for individual plants:

```{r co2_mod2_ggplot,echo=FALSE, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="\\label{fig:co2_mod2_pred}Predicted uptake values (lines) verus oberved uptake for each plant, based on CO2 model 2."}
CO2_mod2_pred <- predict(CO2_mod2, se.fit=TRUE)
CO2$mod2 <- CO2_mod2_pred$fit
CO2$mod2_se <- CO2_mod2_pred$se.fit

ggplot(data=CO2, aes(x=conc, y=uptake, group=Plant_uo)) +
  facet_wrap(~Plant_uo) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y=exp(mod2))) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=exp(mod2-2*mod2_se),
                  ymax=exp(mod2+2*mod2_se)), alpha=0.25)
```

The "`fs`"-based approach mentioned above does not work for higher-dimensional tensor product smooths (if one is willing to use thin plate regression splines for the multivariate smooth then one can use "`fs`"). Instead, the group-specific term can be specified with a tensor product of the continuous smooths and a random effect for the grouping parameter. This term will again have a separate set of basis functions for each group, one penalty for the smooth term, and a second penalty drawing all basis functions toward zero[^fs_note]. e.g.: `y~te(x1,x2,bs="tp",m=2)+te(x1,x2, fac,bs=c("tp","tp","re"),m=1)`. We illustrate this approach below on the bird migration data. 


[^fs_note]: Note that this differs from the "fs" penalty, which assigned one penalty per null space term.

```{r bird_mod2, fig.width=4, fig.height=4}
bird_mod2 <- gam(count ~ te(week, latitude, bs=c("cc", "tp"),
                            k=c(10, 10), m=c(2, 2)) +
                         te(week, latitude, species, bs=c("cc", "tp", "re"),
                            k=c(10, 10, 6), m=c(1, 1, 1)),
                 data=bird_move, method="REML", family=poisson)

```



```{r bird_mod2_ggplot, fig.width=8, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:bird_mod2}a) Predicted migration paths for each species based on bird_mod2, with lighter colors corresponding to higher predicted counts. b) Observed counts versus predictions from bird_mod2."}
bird_move$mod2 <- predict(bird_mod2, type="response")

bird_mod2_indiv = ggplot(data=bird_move, aes(x=week, y=latitude, fill=mod2)) +
  geom_tile(size=1) +
  facet_grid(.~species) +
  scale_fill_viridis("predicted count") +
  scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0, 0), breaks=c(1, 26, 52)) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0, 0), breaks=c(0, 30, 60))+
  cowplot::theme_cowplot()+
  theme(legend.position="bottom")
  
bird_mod2_indiv_fit = ggplot(data=bird_move, aes(x=mod2, y=count)) +
  facet_grid(.~species) +
  geom_point()+
  geom_abline()+
  labs(x="Predicted counts (model 2)", y= "Observed\ncounts")+
  cowplot::theme_cowplot()
  
cowplot::plot_grid(bird_mod2_indiv,bird_mod2_indiv_fit, ncol=1,  align="v", 
                   labels=c("a","b"),rel_heights= c(1.25,1))
  
```

Model 2 is able to effectively capture the observed patterns of interspecific 
variation in migration behaviour (figure \ref{fig:bird_mod2}a), shows a much 
tigher fit between observed and predicted values, as well as less evidence of 
over-dispersion in some species compared to model 1 (figure \ref{fig:bird_mod2}b). 

### A single common smooth plus group-level smooths with differing wigglyness (Model 3)


This model class is very similar to model 2, but we now allow each group-specific smooth to have its own smoothing parameter and hence it's own level of wigglyness. This increases the computational cost of the model, and means that the only information shared between groups is through the global smoothing term. This is useful if different groups differ substantially in how variable they are.

Fitting a seperate smooth term (with its own penalties) can be done in `mgcv` by using the `by=fac` argument in the `s()` function. Therefore, we can code this model as: `y~s(x,bs="tp") + s(x, by=fac, m=1, bs= "ts") + s(fac, bs="re")`. Note two major differences from how model 2 was specified: 1., we explicitly include a random effect for the intercept (the `bs="re"` term), as group-specific intercepts are not incorporated into these smooth terms automatically (as would be the case with `bs="fs"` or a tensor product random effect); 2., we explicitly use a basis with a fully penalized null space for the group-level smooth (`bs="ts"`, for  "thin plate with shrinkage"), as this method does not automatically penalize the nullspace, so there is potential for co-linearity issues between unpenalized components of the global and group-level smoothers.

Our `CO2` model is then modified as follows:

```{r mod3_CO2-norun, eval=FALSE}
CO2_mod3 = gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k=5, m=2, bs="tp") +
                             s(log(conc), by= Plant_uo, k=5, bs="ts", m=1) +
                             s(Plant_uo, bs="re", k=12),
               data= CO2, method="REML")
```

```{r mod3_CO2, fig.width=5, fig.height=3, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="\\label{fig:co2_mod3}Functional relationships for the CO2 data estimated for model 3. Top left: the global smooth; Top middle: species-specific random effect intercepts. The remaining plots are a selected subset of the plant-specific smoothers, indicating how the functional response of that plant differs from the global smooth."}
CO2_mod3 = gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), k=5, m=2, bs="tp") +
                             s(log(conc), by= Plant_uo, k=5, bs="ts", m=1) +
                             s(Plant_uo, bs="re", k=12),
               data= CO2, method="REML")

par(mfrow=c(2, 3), mar =c(4, 4, 1, 1))
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=1, ylab="global smooth", seWithMean=TRUE)
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=14, ylab="Intercepts", main=NA)
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=3, ylab="Plant Qn1", seWithMean=TRUE)
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=5, ylab="Plant Qc1", seWithMean=TRUE)
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=10, ylab="Plant Mn1", seWithMean=TRUE)
plot(CO2_mod3, scale=0, select=13, ylab="Plant Mc1", seWithMean=TRUE)
```

Figure \ref{fig:co2_mod3} shows a subsample of the group-specific smooths from this model, to prevent crowding. It is appearent from this that some groups (e.g. `Qc1`) have very similar shapes to the global smooth (differing only in intercept), others do differ from the global trend, with higher uptake at low concentrations and lower uptake at higher concentrations (e.g. `Mc1`, `Qn1`), or the reverse pattern (e.g. `Mn1`).

Using model 3 with higher-dimensional data is also straightforward; `by=fac` terms work as well in tensor-product smooths as they do with isotrophic smooths. We can see this with our bird model:


```{r mod3_bird, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
bird_mod3 <- gam(count ~ te(week, latitude, bs=c("cc", "tp"),
                            k=c(10, 10), m=c(2, 2)) +
                         te(week, latitude, bs= c("cc", "tp"),
                            k=c(10, 10), m=c(1, 1), by=species),
                 data=bird_move, method="REML", family=poisson)
```

The fitted model for bird_mod3 is visually indistinguishable from bird_mod2 (figure \ref{fig:bird_mod2}} so we do not illustrate it here. 

### Models without global smooth terms (models 4 and 5)

We can modify the above models to exclude the global term (which is generally faster; see section V). When we don't model the global term, we are allowing each factor to be different, though there may be some similarities in the shape of the functions.


#### Model 4:

Model 4 (shared smooths) is simply model 2 without the global smooth term: `y~s(x,fac,bs="fs")` or `y~te(x1,x2,fac,bs=c("tp","tp","re")`. This model assumes all groups have the same smoothness, but that the individual shapes of the smooth terms are not related. (Plots are very similar to model 2.)

```{r mod4, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
CO2_mod4 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), Plant_uo, k=5,  bs="fs", m=2),
                data=CO2, method="REML")

bird_mod4 <- gam(count ~ te(week, latitude, species, bs=c("cc", "tp", "re"),
                            k=c(10, 10, 6), m=2),
                 data=bird_move, method="REML", family=poisson)
```

#### Model 5:

Model 5 is simply model 3 without the first term: `y~s(x,by=fac)` or `y~te(x1,x2, by=fac)`. (Plots are very similar to model 3.)

```{r mod5, fig.width=6, fig.height=3}
CO2_mod5 <- gam(log(uptake) ~ s(log(conc), by=Plant_uo, k=5, bs="tp", m=2) +
                              s(Plant_uo, bs="re", k=12), data= CO2, method="REML")

bird_mod5 <- gam(count ~ te(week,latitude, by=species, bs= c("cc", "tp"),
                            k=c(10, 10), m = 2),
                 data=bird_move, method="REML", family=poisson)
```

Where group-level smooths are coded using the `by=fac` argument in the `s()` function, ; if the factor is unordered, `mgcv` will set up a model with one smooth for each grouping level. If the factor is ordered, `mgcv` will not set the basis functions for the first grouping level to zero. In model 3 (with an ungrouped smooth included) the ungrouped smooth will then correspond to the first grouping level, rather than the average functional response, and the group-specific smooths will correspond to deviations from the first group. In model 5, using an ordered factor will result in the first group not having a smooth term associated with it at all.
